actor "User" as user
participant "HCP Boundary\nController" as hcp
participant "Credential Store\n(Vault/Static)" as vault
box "AWS VPC" #LightBlue
    participant "Boundary Worker\n(EC2 Public Subnet)" as worker
    participant "Cassandra DB\n(EC2 Private Subnet)" as cassandra
end box

== Session Initiation ==
user -> hcp: boundary connect cassandra -target-id <target-id>
hcp -> hcp: Authorize user access\nto target

== Credential Brokering ==
hcp -> vault: Request Cassandra credentials
vault -> hcp: Return username/password

== Session Establishment ==
hcp -> worker: Establish session with\nbrokered credentials
worker -> cassandra: Test connectivity (port 9042)
cassandra -> worker: Connection confirmed
worker -> hcp: Session ready
hcp -> user: Return proxy details\n(local port, session info)

== User Connection ==
user -> worker: Connect via localhost proxy
worker -> cassandra: Forward CQL with brokered credentials

== Active Session ==
loop CQL Session
    user -> worker: CQL commands
    worker -> cassandra: Execute queries
    cassandra -> worker: Results
    worker -> user: Return results
end
